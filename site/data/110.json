    "description": "\u201cGod Save The Key\u201d by artist YuYu takes a spin on renaissance masterpieces to humourlessly remind us the importance of self sovereignty - Not your Keys, Not your coins. YuYu's reinterpretation of Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1786) draws inspiration from the three depicted brothers and their unity, reflecting the collective efforts of the web3 community to defend and uphold its ethos.   \n   \nAdditionally, the artwork combines elements from Karl Brullov's The Last Day of Pompeii (1833), lighting with its eruption the left corner of the background, and Briton Riviere's lions from Daniel's Answer to the King (1892) encircle the main character, serving as indicators of imminent danger. Through these conceptual elements, the work depicts the turbulent nature of cryptocurrency while emphasizing the vital role of unity and collective action in fortifying decentralization.  \n   \nArtworks used:   \n1.

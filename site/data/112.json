    "description": "Yesterday, dawn arose, morning's haunting grace.   \nTime stood still, night revealed its face.   \nThose present yesterday, might not be here tomorrow,   \nEchoes of them linger, evoking hope and sorrow.   \nThe Green remains silent, unaware what lies behind.   \nDoors keep their secrets, hidden from our eyes.   \nIt doesn't choose the hour, nor is it bound by place,   \nTranscending softly, traversing time and space.   \n  \nMeme: 4  \nSeason: 3  \nCard: 4",

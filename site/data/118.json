    "description": "6529 Meme Cards. 2023 June #118. Speaking the words of a forgotten playbook,   \nSeize the memes of production, captivatingly.   \nCages of thought lock the mind in a classroom;   \nCovering the walls with the blanket of language.   \nHappiness and sorrows paint stories on canvases,   \nSeeking meaning from a lexicon of symbols.   \nYearning to break out and break free,   \nThe animals are on a quest for the light.   \nScurrying to end a never-ending wait,   \nShouting from behind bars in deep despair.   \nRacing beyond their socially umpired course,   \nThey battle onwards with a roar of hope.   \n  \nMeme: 1  \nSeason: 3  \nCard: 8",

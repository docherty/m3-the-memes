    "description": "The Zestaphoni Ferroalloy Plant, a metallurgical factory that was established in 1933 during the Soviet era, is located in the country of Georgia and has been in operation 24/7 ever since. The plant's heating furnaces need to remain active at all times, necessitating continuous monitoring by the workers. Some of the employees have been working at the company 'GM' (Georgian Manganese) for over 40 years, observing firsthand the evolution of industrial society as they help create the alloys that power it.  \n  \nKoopmans traveled to Georgia with a camera and captured this forging of the memes.       \n  \nMeme: 1  \nSeason: 3  \nCard: 1",
